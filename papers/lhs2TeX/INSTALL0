There are two possibilities to install lhs2TeX:

(A) Using Cabal.
(B) Classic configure/make.

=====================================================================

(A) Using Cabal to install lhs2TeX (preferred):

This requires Cabal 1.6 or later. The process is then as usual:

cabal install

if you have cabal-install (included in the Haskell Platform) or

runghc Setup configure
runghc Setup build
runghc Setup install

The third step requires write access to the installation location and
the LaTeX filename database.

=====================================================================

(B) configure/make (might be removed in the future):

The following instructions apply to Unix-like environments.  However,
lhs2TeX does run on Windows systems, too. (If you would like to add
installation instructions or facilitate the installation procedure for
Windows systems, please contact the authors.)

Unpack the archive. Assume that it has been unpacked into directory
"/somewhere". Then say

cd /somewhere/lhs2TeX-@ProgramVersion@
./configure
make
make install

You might need administrator permissions to perform the "make install"
step. Alternatively, you can select your own installation location by
passing the "--prefix" argument to @configure@:

./configure --prefix=/my/local/programs

With lhs2TeX come a couple of library files (containing basic
lhs2TeX formatting directives) that need to be found by the
lhs2TeX binary. The default search path is as follows:
